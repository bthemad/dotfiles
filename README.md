# Dotfiles
## Zsh
This is the main one and the most "advanced".
Living on the bleeding edge of technology I'm using [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) for managing zsh plugins.
My own tweaks and configs resign in the `zsh/custom` directory. Apart from it, you have hostname and platform-specific files that are loaded separately.

## Bash
These files were not update in a long time, but still offer a good deal of nice shortcuts and tweaking.
